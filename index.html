          <p>Aadhaar card or simply 'Aadhaar' is 12 digit unique-identity number issued to every Indian resident. It is considered as a proof of residence. Many people think it is an identity proof which is actually incorrect. The data of every individual is collected and handled by UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India) which was established in 2009 by the Government of India. </p>

  <p>According to UIDAI's recently released stats, as of 30 November 2017, 1.19 billion people have been issued the Aadhaar number. India has 1.20 billion people and if we go with the official data, 99% population of India has Aadhaar proof. Which also makes Aadhaar the world's largest biometric ID system. </p>

  <p>Aadhaar's 12 digit number is unique to every individual as it is basically based on the biometric information of a person. As biometric information can't be changed and is unique to every human being; 12 digit Aadhaar number is issued only once to a person. </p>

  <p>Note: Biometric information includes Fingerprints of all ten fingers (fingers and thumb of both hands) and Iris. </p>

  <p>In case, If the person whose Aadhaar number is already issued and UIDAI has the biometric information of the person and that person tries to create another Aadhaar card (intentionally or unintentionally); it can't be done because the system already has the person's biometric details. Hence, for every unique biometric information system generates a 12 digit unique number which is linked to the person's biometric and demographic details.</p>

  <h2 id="1">What is e-Aadhaar and how is it different from Aadhaar?</h2>
  <p>The only difference between Aadhaar and e-Aadhaar is that Aadhaar is physical, while e-Aadhaar is digital. The feature is probably first released in 2013.</p>

  <p>As the usages of Aadhaar is increasing and considered important for many things in India. For example, even to get a new SIM card one can use Aadhaar card as a proof of address.Taking the physical copy of it sometimes isn’t possible, in fact, many times one can forget it. In such case, e-Aadhaar is handy as it is digital you can carry and access it anywhere even on your smartphone, computer, pen drive, online, etc.</p>

  <p>Let me give you an example, suppose you booked a smartphone online and when it reached your destination the delivery person sometimes ask you for an ID proof (always remember, Aadhaar officially isn’t considered an identity proof as said by UIDAI, but sometimes it can be skipped for such things) you can use show your e-Aadhaar card in such scenario especially when you don’t have access to your Physical Aadhaar.</p>

  <h2 id="2">How to download e-Aadhaar Card Online?</h2>
  <p>Always remember that Aadhaar card can only be downloaded from the official UIDAI website, other than that there is no any website from where you can download it.</p>

  <p>Before following this tutorial make sure that your Aadhaar is approved.</p>

  <p>You must ready with the few personal details and especially your registered mobile number before you can be able to download e-Aadhaar.</p>

  <h3 id="3">Follow the below steps carefully:</h3>

  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the official e-Aadhaar website through here: <a target="_blank" href="https://eaadhaar.uidai.gov.in/">https://eaadhaar.uidai.gov.in/</a></p>

  <p><strong>Special Note (Be Careful!)  </strong></p>
  <p>Note: Make sure you visit an official UIDAI website and not any fake website with the similar look as the original, as you have to enter some confidential details take time to verify the originality of the website. Original website URL address starts with the HTTPS and has .gov.in in the end. In case you are not sure Google ‘e-Aadhaar download UIDAI’ and click on the first link of the search page or simply use above given URL.</p>

  <p><strong>Step 2: </strong> On next page, you will have a form which you need to fill. On the first step choose one between, I have* Enrolment Id Aadhaar  <– It would look something like this. No matter what you choose make sure that you have what you are choosing if you have Aadhaar number choose it and if you have Enrolment number choose that.</p>

  <p>Fill The Details (Follow below picture)</p>
  <img src="/images/fill-the-details-on-aadhaar-uidai-official-website.png" alt="Fill The Details e-Aadhaar Download " width="605" height="414" />

  <p>Now enter whatever number you have chosen and then your full name, Pin code and fill the captcha image text. Now click on ‘Get One Time Password‘ after that you will receive an OTP through SMS on your registered mobile number.</p>

  <p>The second step on the page will ask you to enter OTP that you received on your mobile phone. If you don’t receive within 10 minutes then click on ‘Resend One Time Password‘. After entering the OTP click on ‘Validate & Download‘.</p>

  <p>And within 10 seconds the download of E-Aadhaar will start.</p>

  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the download completed you may open the PDF file, but before you can access it there is one more step. To protect your e-Aadhaar UIDAI set an 8 character password on the file.</p>

  <p>The password is the first 4 letters of your name and your birth year.</p>

  <img class="aligncenter wp-image-25 " src="/images/eAadhaar_password.jpg" alt="8 character e-Aadhaar Password" width="574" height="360" />

   <p>For example, your name is <strong>Ramesh Singh</strong> and your date of birth is <strong>12-03-1995</strong> so the password of the PDF file would be <strong>RAME1997</strong> (First Four Letters of your name+Birth Year)</p>
  <p>That’s it. Enjoy your e-Aadhaar card.</p>
